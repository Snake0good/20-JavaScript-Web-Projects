A link to the website I'll be following - https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects

Here is the list I'll be doing. 

✅ - Finished Projects
1. Quote Generator - Fetch, Async/Await, Quote API, CORS
    - this was okay. the API was fun to use and I got the hang of it. Haven't fully figured out the loader yet :/
2. Infinite Scroll - Fetch, Async/Await, Unsplash API, DOM, Scroll Event Listener
    - better luck today - got the loader working... basic, but moving on up
3. Joke Teller - Fetch, Async/Await, Joke API, Text-to-Speech
    - harder than I thought. basic but nice way build. gotta revisit it to refresh the concepts. 
4. Light/Dark Mode - DOM, localStorage
    - spent about 4 hours playing with this guy. loved it. enjoyed the "bugs"
5. Infinite Scroll (x2) - 
    - went back to this one, and made it with an UnSplash API instead of a text heavy quote API
6. Animated Navigation - CSS Animations
    - AOS.js and Tailwind was the focus here. So much possibility with these.
